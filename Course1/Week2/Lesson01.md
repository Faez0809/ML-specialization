# 📘 Multiple Linear Regression – Detailed Notes

This lecture explains **Multiple Linear Regression**, which allows us to use **multiple features (inputs)** to make better predictions compared to using only one feature.  
It also introduces **notations** 📑 and a **compact vectorized form** ⚡.

---

## 1️⃣ From Single Feature to Multiple Features

### 🔹 Single Feature Model (Univariate Regression)
$$
f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b
$$

- Uses only **one input feature**.  
- Example: Predicting house price using only **size of the house (sq. feet)**.

![](./images(w2)/onef.png)

---

### 🔹 Multiple Features Model (Multiple Linear Regression)
- Uses **several input features** → more accurate predictions.  
- Example: House price prediction using:  
  1. 🏠 Size of the house ($x_1$)  
  2. 🛏️ Number of bedrooms ($x_2$)  
  3. 🏢 Number of floors ($x_3$)  
  4. 📅 Age of the home in years ($x_4$)  



---

## 2️⃣ Notation for Multiple Features ✍️

To handle multiple inputs, we use structured notation:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example (if n=4) |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **n** | Number of features | n = 4 |
| **x_j** | The j-th feature | $x_1$ = size, $x_4$ = age |
| **x (vector)** | All features as a vector | [ $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ ] |
| **x^(i)** | i-th training example (vector) | $x^{(2)} = [1416, 3, 2, 40]$ |
| **x^(i)_j** | j-th feature of i-th example | $x^{(2)}_3 = 2$ |

## 3️⃣ The Multiple Linear Regression Model 📊

The model learns **parameters (weights)** for each feature + a bias term.

---

### 🔹 Expanded Form
$$
f_{w,b}(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_4x_4 + b
$$

For **n** features:
$$
f_{w,b}(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b
$$

---

### 🔹 Example with House Prices
$$
f_{w,b}(x) = 0.1x_1 + 4x_2 + 10x_3 - 2x_4 + 80
$$

- 📏 **0.1** → Each extra square foot adds **$100**  
- 🛏️ **4** → Each bedroom adds **$4000**  
- 🏢 **10** → Each floor adds **$10,000**  
- 📉 **-2** → Each year reduces price by **$2000**  
- 💵 **80** → Base price = **$80,000**  

![](./images(w2)/prev.png)

---

## 4️⃣ Vectorized Notation (Compact Form) ⚡

Instead of writing many terms, we use the **dot product**:

$$
f_{w,b}(x) = w \cdot x + b
$$

- **w** = [ $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ ] → parameters (weights)  
- **x** = [ $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ ] → features  

### 🔹 Dot Product Definition:
$$
w \cdot x = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n
$$

✔ Compact form = **shorter, cleaner, faster** to compute.  

![](./images(w2)/dot.png)

---

## 5️⃣ Important Terminology 📖

- **Multiple Linear Regression** → Linear regression with **multiple input features**.  
- **Univariate Regression** → Linear regression with **one feature only**.  
- **Multivariate Regression** → Different concept (predicting multiple outputs), not covered here.  

---

## 6️⃣ Key Insights 🌟

✅ Adding more features improves prediction accuracy.  
✅ Each weight ($w_j$) shows how much that feature affects the result.  
✅ Positive weight → increases output, Negative weight → decreases output.  
✅ Vectorization makes the model **easier** and **faster** to implement in code.

## 🚀 Next Step
Learn about **vectorization techniques** to compute predictions for **many examples at once** efficiently.

# ⚡ Lec22,23: Vectorization and Efficient Implementation – Notes

This lecture introduces the concept of **vectorization**, a key technique for making machine learning implementations **faster and cleaner**.  
Vectorization allows code to leverage optimized math libraries (like **NumPy**) and specialized hardware (like **GPUs**) for parallel computation.

---

## 1️⃣ Power and Benefits of Vectorization 🚀

Vectorization provides two major benefits:

1. **Shorter, Cleaner Code** ✍️  
   - Complex mathematical operations (e.g., dot product) can be written in **one line**.  

2. **Much Faster Execution** ⏩  
   - Vectorized code runs far more efficiently than non-vectorized code.  
   - It uses optimized low-level implementations and parallel hardware.  

![](./images(w2)/v1.png)

---

## 2️⃣ Implementing the Multiple Linear Regression Model 🏠

The model can be written using vectorized math:

$$
f_{w,b}(x) = w \cdot x + b
$$

where:  
- **w** = vector of parameters $[w_1, w_2, ..., w_n]$  
- **x** = vector of features $[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$  

---

### A. Without Vectorization (Explicit Listing)
Example:  
$$
f = w_0x_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b
$$

- Works but is inefficient and hard to code if $n$ is large (e.g., $100,000$).  
![](./images(w2)/v2.png)


---

### B. Without Vectorization (For Loop)
Mathematical form:
$$
f = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j x_j + b
$$

Python code:
```python
f = 0
for j in range(n):
    f = f + w[j] * x[j]
f = f + b
```

- ✅ Cleaner than explicit listing  
- ❌ Still **slow** because it runs sequentially  


---

### C. With Vectorization (Efficient Approach)
Python (NumPy) implementation:
```python
f = np.dot(w, x) + b
```

- ✅ One line of code  
- ✅ Extremely fast using optimized numerical libraries  
- ✅ Scales well for very large $n$  

![](./images(w2)/v3.png)

---

## 3️⃣ How Vectorization Works Behind the Scenes 🔍

### Without Vectorization (Sequential Execution)
- Each operation is computed **step by step**.  
- At time $t_0$, compute $w_0x_0$ → then $t_1$, compute $w_1x_1$, etc.  

### With Vectorization (Parallel Execution)
- All multiplications $w_j x_j$ are computed **at the same time in parallel**.  
- Specialized hardware then **adds all results together quickly**.  

➡️ This makes vectorized code **much faster** and scalable to huge datasets.  



---

## 4️⃣ Vectorized Parameter Updates (Gradient Descent) 🔄

Gradient Descent update rule (non-vectorized):  
$$
w_j = w_j - \alpha \cdot d_j \quad \text{for } \; j = 1, \dots, n
$$

where:  
- $\alpha$ = learning rate  
- $d_j$ = derivative for $w_j$
  

---

### 🔹 Non-Vectorized Update
Python loop:
```python
for j in range(n):
    w[j] = w[j] - 0.1 * d[j]
```

### 🔹 Vectorized Update
Python (NumPy):
```python
w = w - 0.1 * d
```

✔ Updates **all weights simultaneously**  
✔ Uses parallel processing for efficiency  


---

## 5️⃣ Key Insights 🌟

- Vectorization makes ML code **shorter and much faster**.  
- Non-vectorized code = **sequential execution** (slow).  
- Vectorized code = **parallel execution** (efficient).  
- Essential for scaling algorithms to **large datasets** and **large models**.  

---

## 🚀 Next Step
Explore the **NumPy library** in detail:
- Creating arrays  
- Performing vector operations (`np.dot`, element-wise multiplication)  
- Timing comparisons between vectorized and non-vectorized code  

This will prepare us to implement **gradient descent with vectorization**.  

---
# 📘 Lec24: Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

This lecture combines **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** with **Gradient Descent** and **Vectorization** to efficiently implement the learning algorithm.  
It also introduces an alternative method: the **Normal Equation**.

---

## 1️⃣ Vectorized Notation for Parameters and Model ✍️

### 🔹 Parameter Simplification
- Instead of treating $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ as separate parameters, collect them into a **vector $w$** of length $n$.  
- The bias $b$ remains a single number.

### 🔹 Model Formulation
The MLR model becomes:

$$
f_{w,b}(x) = w \cdot x + b
$$

where $w \cdot x$ is the **dot product**.

### 🔹 Cost Function
The cost function, which depends on all weights and bias, is now written compactly as:

$$
J(w, b)
$$

![](./images(w2)/pn.png)
---

## 2️⃣ Gradient Descent Update Rules 🔄

Gradient Descent updates each weight $w_j$ and the bias $b$ repeatedly.

### 🔹 General Update Rule
For each weight:
$$
w_j = w_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial w_j} J(w, b)
$$

For bias:
$$
b = b - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial}{\partial b} J(w, b)
$$

where $\alpha$ = learning rate.

---

### 🔹 MLR Derivative Term
The derivative term is similar to the univariate case but now accounts for **multiple features**:

- Error term: $(f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})$  
- For feature $j$: multiply the error by $x_j^{(i)}$ (value of feature $j$ in the $i^{th}$ training example).  

Thus:
$$
w_j = w_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Big( f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \Big) x_j^{(i)}
$$

and
$$
b = b - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Big( f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \Big)
$$

✔ All $w_j$ (for $j=1,...,n$) and $b$ are updated **simultaneously**.

![](./images(w2)/gd.png)
---

## 3️⃣ Alternative Method: Normal Equation 📐

The **Normal Equation** is a closed-form solution to find $w, b$ without iterations.

### 🔹 Key Characteristics
- Solves parameters directly using linear algebra.  
- Formula: $w = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ (not shown in detail in lecture).  
- No need for gradient descent iterations.  

### 🔹 Disadvantages
- ❌ Only works for **linear regression**.  
- ❌ Does **not generalize** to other algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, neural nets).  
- ❌ Very slow when number of features $n > 10,000$.  

### 🔹 Practical Use
- Sometimes used inside ML libraries for small datasets.  
- But in practice, **Gradient Descent is the recommended method** because it scales well.  

![](./images(w2)/nm.png)

---

## 4️⃣ Key Insights 🌟
- Multiple Linear Regression works well with **vectorization + gradient descent**.  
- Gradient Descent updates all weights **simultaneously**.  
- Normal Equation can solve parameters directly but has **major limitations**.  
- GD is the **preferred method** in most real-world ML tasks.  

---

## 🚀 Next Step
The following lab demonstrates:  
- Implementing **MLR with numpy**  
- Computing predictions, cost, and gradient descent updates  
- Preparing for improvements like **feature scaling** and **learning rate tuning**  

---
# ⚡ Lec 25,26 :Feature Scaling for Gradient Descent Efficiency

Feature scaling is a crucial technique that ensures **gradient descent runs faster and converges more smoothly**.  
It transforms features in the training data so they share a **comparable range of values**.

---

## 1️⃣ The Problem: Unequal Feature Ranges and Parameter Sizes ⚠️

Gradient descent efficiency depends heavily on the ranges of input features.

### 🔹 Feature vs Parameter Relationship
- **Large range feature ($x_1$ – size in feet², up to 2000):**  
  → Needs a **small weight** (e.g., $w_1 = 0.1$).  
- **Small range feature ($x_2$ – bedrooms, 0–5):**  
  → Needs a **large weight** (e.g., $w_2 = 50$).  

![](./images(w2)/25.1.png)

---

### 🔹 Effect on Cost Function
- With unequal ranges, the **cost function contours** ($J(w, b)$) look like **tall, skinny ellipses**.  
- This causes gradient descent to **zig-zag** and converge slowly.

![](./images(w2)/25.2.png)

---

## 2️⃣ The Solution: Rescaling Features ✅

Scaling features to **comparable ranges** (e.g., between 0 and 1) fixes the problem.

- Cost contours become **rounder (more like circles)**.  
- Gradient descent takes a **direct path** to the global minimum.  

![](./images(w2)/25.3.png)

---

## 3️⃣ Implementation Methods ⚙️

### A. **Scaling by Maximum (Normalization to [0, 1])**
Formula:  
$$
x_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{x}{\max(x)}
$$

- Example:  
  - $x_1$ (300–2000) → divide by 2000 → range [0.15, 1]  
  - $x_2$ (0–5) → divide by 5 → range [0, 1]  

![](./images(w2)/26.1.png)

---

### B. **Mean Normalization (Centering Around Zero)**
Formula:  
$$
x_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{x - \mu}{\max - \min}
$$

- Centers features around 0.  
- Values typically between -1 and +1.  

![](./images(w2)/26.2.png)

---

### C. **Z-Score Normalization (Standardization)**
Formula:  
$$
x_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

- Uses mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$).  
- Ensures values cluster around 0 with unit variance.  

![](./images(w2)/26.3.png)

---

## 4️⃣ Rule of Thumb for Target Ranges 🎯

- Aim for features in range: **[-1, 1]** (roughly).  
- Acceptable: [-3, 3] or [-0.3, 0.3].  
- When to rescale:
  - Too large (e.g., -100 to 100) → rescale.  
  - Too small (e.g., -0.001 to 0.001) → rescale.  
  - Centered around big values (e.g., 98.6–105) → rescale.  

![](./images(w2)/26.4.png)

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Feature scaling **improves speed & stability** of gradient descent.  
- Several methods: **Max scaling, Mean normalization, Z-score**.  
- Rule of thumb: Always bring features into a range around **-1 to +1**.  
- "Almost never any harm" in applying scaling — so when in doubt, scale! 🚀
# 📉 Lec27,28:Monitoring Convergence & Choosing Learning Rate ($\alpha$)

This overview combines **Lesson 27** and **Lesson 28**, focusing on how to **verify gradient descent is working correctly** and how to **choose an effective learning rate**.

---

## 1️⃣ Monitoring Convergence with the Learning Curve (Lesson 27)

To ensure gradient descent is converging toward the global minimum, plot the **cost function $J$ vs iterations**.

### 🔹 Learning Curve
- **X-axis:** Number of iterations.  
- **Y-axis:** Cost function $J(w, b)$.  
- **Expected Behavior:** $J$ should **decrease every iteration**.  
- **Convergence:** Curve flattens → gradient descent has converged.  
- Iterations needed can vary (30, 1,000, even 100,000).  
![](./images(w2)/27.1.png)
![](./images(w2)/27.2.png)

---

### 🔹 Diagnosing Problems
- If $J$ **increases at any step**:
  - Likely $\alpha$ (learning rate) is **too large**.  
  - Or there’s a **bug in code**.  

### 🔹 Automatic Convergence Test
Define a small $\epsilon$ (e.g., $0.001$).  
- If $J$ decreases by less than $\epsilon$ in one iteration → **declare convergence**.  
- But in practice, **visual inspection of the learning curve** is often preferred.  


![](./images(w2)/27.2.png)
---

## 2️⃣ Choosing the Learning Rate ($\alpha$) (Lesson 28)

The learning rate determines how fast or slow gradient descent converges.

### 🔹 When $\alpha$ is Too Large
- Cost oscillates (goes up & down) or diverges.  
- Geometric reason: updates **overshoot the minimum**.  
- Fix: Use a **smaller $\alpha$**.  

### 🔹 When $\alpha$ is Too Small
- Converges **very slowly**.  
- Debugging tip: With a very small $\alpha$, $J$ should **always decrease**.  
  - If not, there’s likely a **bug** (e.g., using `+` instead of `-` in the update rule).  

![](./images(w2)/28.1.png)

---

### 🔹 Strategy to Find the Best $\alpha$
- Try multiple values: **0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1...**  
- Increase by factors of **~3 each time**.  
- Look for:
  - Too small → slow convergence.  
  - Too large → unstable or diverging.  
- Choose the **largest $\alpha$ that converges smoothly**.  

![](./images(w2)/28.2.png)
---

## ✅ Key Insights
- Always **plot learning curves** to check if gradient descent is decreasing cost properly.  
- A good $\alpha$ is the **largest stable value** for fast convergence.  
- If $J$ goes up:
  - Likely $\alpha$ too big, or  
  - Implementation bug in update rule.  

🚀 Next steps: Improve MLR by **designing better features** for more powerful models.


# 📘Lec 29,30 Feature Engineering & Polynomial Regression

This summary combines **Lesson 29** (Feature Engineering) and **Lesson 30** (Polynomial Regression).  
Both lessons explain how the **choice and design of features** can dramatically impact how well a model performs.

---

## 🔹 1. Feature Engineering (Lesson 29)

👉 **Definition:**  
Feature engineering is the process of using **intuition** or **domain knowledge** to design **new features**, often by transforming or combining original ones.

⚡ Why it matters:  
The **choice of features** has a **huge impact** on the learning algorithm’s performance.

### 🏡 Example: Predicting House Prices

- **Original Features:**
  - $x_1$ = **Frontage (Width)** of the land
  - $x_2$ = **Depth** of the land

- **Problem with Original Model:**  
  $$ f_{\vec{w},b}(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b $$

- **New Feature Idea:**  
  Since **area = frontage × depth**, add a new feature:  
  $$ x_3 = x_1 \times x_2 $$

- **Improved Model:**  
  $$ f_{\vec{w},b}(x) = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + b $$

✅ Benefit: The model can automatically decide whether **frontage, depth, or area** matters more.

![](./images(w2)/29.1.png)

---

## 🔹 2. Polynomial Regression (Lesson 30)

👉 **Definition:**  
Polynomial regression is a type of feature engineering where you create **powers of an original feature** to allow the model to fit **curves (non-linear functions)**.


### 📈 Example: Housing Price vs Size

- **Straight Line Model:**  
  Not always a good fit if the data has curves.

- **Quadratic (Degree 2):**

$$
f(x) = w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + b
$$

⚠ Problem: Quadratic curves eventually bend down, which may not reflect real house prices.


- **Cubic (Degree 3):**

$$
f(x) = w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + w_3 x^3 + b
$$

✅ Better for modeling continuous price growth.


![](./images(w2)/30.1.png)

---

### 🔄 Alternative Non-Linear Features

- Instead of powers, we could use **other transformations**, such as the square root:  
  $$ f_{\vec{w},b}(x) = w_1 x + w_2 \sqrt{x} + b $$

- ✅ Benefit: Square root grows slower, never curves down, can better represent diminishing returns.

![](./images(w2)/30,2.png)

---

## ⚠ Importance of Feature Scaling in Polynomial Regression

When using higher-order features:

- If $x$ ranges from **1 → 1000**:
  - $x^2$ ranges from **1 → 1,000,000**
  - $x^3$ ranges from **1 → 1,000,000,000**

⚡ Because of these large ranges:
- **Gradient descent may become very slow.**
- **Feature scaling is essential** to bring values into a similar range.

---

## 🔮 3. Future Directions

- Choosing the **best set of features** is critical → covered later in **Course 2 (Model Selection)**.
- In practice, libraries like **scikit-learn** can automatically implement polynomial regression and scaling.
- Still, **understanding the manual process** is essential for mastering ML.
