# 📘 Lecture 3 – Defining Machine Learning & Specialization Focus

---

## 📝 Formal Definition of ML
- **Arthur Samuel (1950s)** defined ML as:  
  > "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."

---

## 🎮 Historical Example: Samuel’s Checkers Program
- Samuel built a **checkers-playing program**.  
- He wasn’t a strong player himself, but the program:  
  - Played **tens of thousands of games against itself**.  
  - Learned which **board positions led to wins** vs. losses.  
  - Improved over time → eventually **outperformed Samuel**.  

💡 **Key Principle**:  
The more practice (data/examples) a learning algorithm has, the **better it performs**.  
- Example: If the program had only played 100 games, it would be weak.  
- But with 10,000+ games, it became strong.

## 🔑 Two Main Types of ML Algorithms
1. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Learns from **labeled data** (input + correct answer).  
   - Example: Predicting house prices from features like size, location, etc.  

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Learns from **unlabeled data** (only input, no correct answer).  
   - Example: Grouping customers into segments based on buying habits.

## 📚 Course Structure
- **Course 1 & 2** → Focus on **Supervised Learning**.  
- **Course 3** → Covers **Unsupervised Learning, Recommender Systems, and Reinforcement Learning**.  
- Most widely used ML methods today:  
  - Supervised Learning  
  - Unsupervised Learning  
  - Recommender Systems

## 🛠️ Practical Application & Best Practices
- Learning algorithms = **having tools**.  
- Success depends on **knowing how to use them effectively**.  
- Even experienced teams can spend **months going the wrong way** if they lack best practices.  
- This course will teach **how top ML engineers build real systems**, making learners capable of building **serious ML projects**.

## ⏭️ What’s Next?
- Next Lectures will explain:  
  - **Supervised learning** in detail.  
  - **Unsupervised learning** in detail.  
  - When to use each method.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- ML enables computers to learn without explicit programming.  
- Arthur Samuel’s checkers program showed the **power of self-learning**.  
- Two main ML types: **Supervised** and **Unsupervised**.  
- The course focuses on both algorithms **and** real-world best practices.
