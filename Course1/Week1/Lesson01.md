# 📘 Lecture 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is defined as **the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed**.  
We interact with ML many times daily, often without even realizing it.

# 📘 Lecture 2 – The Value and Scope of Machine Learning

---

## 🌟 Why Machine Learning?
- ML is a **subfield of AI**, created to build intelligent machines.  
- For many complex tasks (speech recognition, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis), **explicit programming is impossible**.  
- Solution → Let machines **learn by themselves**.  

---

## 🌍 Scope & Impact
- **Massive adoption** → Hundreds of thousands of professionals already use ML.  
- **Industry agnostic** → ML will affect nearly *every industry*.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Speech recognition  
  - Google Maps Street View (vision)  
  - Advertising & e-commerce  
  - Fraud detection  
  - Self-driving cars  
  - Healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture  

---

## 💰 Economic Value
- **$13 trillion/year** → Estimated value AI/ML will create by **2030** (McKinsey).  
- **Beyond software** → Huge opportunities in retail, transport, automotive, materials, agriculture.  
- **High demand** → Big shortage of ML skills → great time to learn.  

---

## 🧠 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- **Goal** → Machines as intelligent as humans.  
- **Reality** → Overhyped; still **decades or centuries away**.  
- **Path** → Progress will come through **learning algorithms**, possibly inspired by the brain.  

---

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Learn and implement **state-of-the-art ML algorithms**.  
- Understand the **most important algorithms** used in industry.  
- Gain **practical tips & tricks** to optimize performance.  
- Next: Formal definition of ML, types of problems, and key terminology.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- ML solves problems too complex for traditional programming.  
- ML is spreading across *all industries*, with massive economic potential.  
- We are far from AGI, but ML is today’s most impactful path in AI.  
- This course focuses on both **theory and hands-on practice**.
